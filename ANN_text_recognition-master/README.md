# ANN_text_recognition
this is a text recognition using ANN Algorithm

Dependency:
Python 3.6.5
Keras 2.2.4
Tensorflow 1.9.0
Opencv-python 4.1.1.26
Numpy
Matplotlib
Jupyterlab


First, install the python ver 3.6.5, then you can install depedency one by one by using this syntax on Terminal or Command promp "pip install <packet-name>", or install all at once using "pip install -r requirements.txt "

After install all dependency, run jupyter lab on terminal / command prompt using "jupyter lab", then the jupyter lab will open automatically on your default browser

after that, you can learn how to train & create your own ANN model based algorithm by opening the "Training_andcreate_model.ipynb"
then you can test your model use "use_model.ipynb"
